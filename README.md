# source_modelMEE

In this github repository the executable of the NUCOMBog model can be found. The model is available for LINUX (UNIX) and Windows. In the folders a precompiled executable can be found. These executables have been tested and work without installation.

In case the user wants to compile the software, the necessary files are in the folder as well (such as makefiles and the source code).

The executable has to be copied into the folder where the input and output folder are (see [a link]https://github.com/jeroenpullens/NUCOMBog_data).
